## Using Emoji/Emotes in Tags

Emoji/Emotes CAN be used in Tags. However, it requires slightly more work due to how discord parses emotes. Normally in Discord, you could just type `:lel:` or `:smile:` to get an emote, however in Cakey Bot, neither of these will work. In order to get valid emojis you have to send the emojis in discord but place a backward slash in front of it to get the emote's full ID. Like so: `\:lel:` or `\:smile:` which will produce these results: `<:lel:408424717217693717>` or for Unicode emoji: `ðŸ˜„` . Once you have the full emoji id or the raw Unicode output, you can paste these into Cakey Bot's web dashboard and they should work as long as Cakey Bot is in a server that has that custom emote in it.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is worth noting that Cakey Bot can use emojis in between servers \(similar to nitro users\). So if you have an emoji in Server \#1, you can use that emoji in a custom command in Server \#2 if Cakey bot is in both of those servers.
{% endhint %}

### Using Images in Tags

To use images in responses, you can simply just type the image URL/link like you would in a normal message. If you have the file on your local machine/PC but no URL/link, you can upload it to an image hosting website \(such as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload)\) and paste the URL they provide into the response. Cakey Bot should automatically embed the image in Discord's client if it's a valid URL/image.
