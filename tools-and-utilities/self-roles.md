# Self Roles/Reaction Roles

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure that Cakey Bot has the **`Manage Roles`** permission and that the Cakey Bot's role is _above_ the roles it is trying to assign.
{% endhint %}

### Self Role Command

Self Roles allows users to add/remove roles to/from their self from a list of roles that has been created/set by the guild admins.

To add/remove a role from this list you can use the `!sr add <role>` and `!sr remove <role>` commands.

To list all roles that can be self assigned you can use the `!sr list` command.

After you have added some roles to the self role list you \(and your users\) can add/remove the roles from yourself using the `!sr use <role>` and `!sr unuse <role>` commands.

### Reaction Roles

{% hint style="danger" %}
This feature is planned and is not currently implemented in the public version of Cakey Bot. Check back later for more information.
{% endhint %}
