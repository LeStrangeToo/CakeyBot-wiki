## Localization \(Multi-Language\)

{% hint style="info" %}
New translations are constantly being added to the bot. This means some strings/phrases may not be translated yet especially for features that have been added recently.
{% endhint %}

Cakey Bot supports 10 different languages. Language can be changed per-server and will apply for every user in that server. You can change the server's language from our web dashboard. You can also change the Web Dashboard's language now. Currently, supported languages are listed below:

* English
* Dutch/Nederlands `(Vikthor)`
* German/Deutsch `(Marcel & MST2)`
* Korean/한국어 `(JohnMarco)`
* Greek/ελληνικά `(xxNikosGaming)`
* Swedish/Svenska `(Casper)`
* Turkish/Türkçe `(Aleph & Oğuzhan)`
* Italian/Italiano `(GiorgioHerbie)`
* Arabic/العربية `(Sipancoolboy)`
* Romanian/Limba română `(Silviu200530)`

We are adding more languages and you can contribute via our Github Repository located [here](https://github.com/MrCakeSlayer/CakeyBot-translations). Once the majority of a language is completed \(&gt;80% translated\) on Github it will be added as an officially supported language.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you plan to contribute, please follow the rules and formatting guidelines provided in the README on the repository page.
