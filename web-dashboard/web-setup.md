# Setup/Login

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will need **`Manage Server`** or **`Administrator`** permission to manage guilds.
{% endhint %}

### Setup

There is no special setup to start customizing Cakey Bot in your guild. To get started all you have to do is login and select the guild you want to modify.

### Login

You can login to our web dashboard by visiting [this link](https://cakeybot.app/dashboard/public). After you login you will be redirected to a list of guilds that you are able to manage. If you attempt to open/manage a guild that Cakey Bot is not in you will be directed to invite Cakey Bot. If Cakey Bot is in the guild you will be redirected to the panel for that guild.

### Manage/Customize

Once you have selected a guild to manage you will be taken to that guild's homepage. The homepage will display basic statistics and general core settings for that guild.

Once you have selected the guild you want to modify you can change various module and core settings for it. For more information on guild settings you can check out [this section](web-dashboard.md).
