### Setup

There is no special setup to start customizing Cakey Bot in your server. To get started all you have to do is login and select the server you want to modify.

### Login

You can login to our web dashboard by visiting [this link](https://cakeybot.app/dashboard/public). After you login you will be redirected to a list of servers that you are able to manage. If you attempt to open/manage a server that Cakey Bot is not in you will be directed to invite Cakey Bot. If Cakey Bot is in the server you will be redirected to the panel for that server.

### Manage/Customize

Once you have selected a server to manage you will be taken to that server's homepage. The homepage will display basic statistics and general core settings for that server.

Once you have selected the server you want to modify you can change various module and core settings for it. For more information on server settings you can check out [this section](web-dashboard.md).
