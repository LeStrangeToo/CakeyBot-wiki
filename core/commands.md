# Command Info

### Command Help

Cakey Bot has a huge collection of commands and features. We are also constantly adding new features and content. In order to keep an up-to-date and accurate command list, we have decided to keep a central list/page for all of our commands. You can access this full page of commands [here](https://cakeybot.app/commands.html).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also access command usage/help directly in discord using the `!help <cmd>` and `!cmdhelp <cmd>` commands. These commands will show usage, parameters, aliases and a command description for any command you pass as an argument.
{% endhint %}

### Prefix

Cakey Bot's prefix is `!` by default. You can replace this with your own unique prefix if you would like by using `!setting prefix <new prefix>` or by using our [web dashboard](https://cakeybot.app/dashboard/public/). If you forget what you set the prefix to you can always use the `!prefix` command, tag/mention the bot or check the web dashboard.

In addition to using the default/custom prefix you can also tag/mention the bot as an alternative to using the prefix. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Prefixes are only applied to commands/custom commands. They are not used for the auto responder or chat triggers.
{% endhint %}

### Slash Commands

Cakey Bot also makes use of Discord's slash command system. All of our slash commands also have a normal command version and both commands will function similarly and will output the same data. The only real differences are that slash commands will prompt you for arguments/parameters if they are required and that some will send "ephemerally", meaning that the results are only shown to you. This means that you can use some slash commands without spamming the chat for everyone else!

### Custom Commands

You can set custom commands alongside Cakey Bot's default commands. For more information on how to do this, check out the [custom command section](../tools-and-utilities/custom-commands.md).
