# Special Permissions/Conditions

### Overview

Some music commands require special permissions or can only be used in specific instances. This page was designed to help demystify these special cases and list the special permissions and conditions

Most commands require a song to be playing/not paused. Some commands are also unable to be used while a live stream is currently playing. In these cases commands will inform you that they are unable to be used why.

### Disconnect Command

Many users have abused the disconnect command as a way to bypass vote skip restrictions. In order to use the disconnect command you must be in the same channel as Cakey Bot and meet one of the conditions below.

* Have [Server Moderator](../setup/faq.md#what-is-considered-a-server-moderator) permissions
* Have a "DJ" role
* Be the only person in the voice channel

### Skip/Vote Skip Command

Most of the time, if you want to skip a song you must vote to skip it with other users. If you run the command after you have already voted to skip, it will cancel/remove your vote to skip. There are some cases where you are able to force-skip the currently playing song. In order to this this, you must meet one of the conditions below.

* Have [Server Moderator](../setup/faq.md#what-is-considered-a-server-moderator) permissions
* Have a "DJ" role
* Be the only person in the voice channel
* Be the user who added the currently playing track

### Play-skip/Remove/Clear Queue

These are normal/generic commands but they can be easily abused by members who are wanting to troll those listening to music. In an effort to prevent trolls these commands requires at least one of the conditions for the user to be true.

* Have [Server Moderator](../setup/faq.md#what-is-considered-a-server-moderator) permissions
* Have a "DJ" role

### Live Streams

Some commands can not be used while a live stream is playing. If you try to use one of these commands while a live stream is playing you will be notified with an error message. In order to use these commands you will either need to wait until the stream ends or use the `!skip` command to go to the next song in the queue. \(or stop playing if the queue is empty\)
